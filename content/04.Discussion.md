## Model Training and Evaluation
### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is the simplest but powerful model. In the previous studies, it was widely used in the prediction of concrete strength. This model assumes a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables.

**Code for Linear Regression Model**
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

lin_reg = LinearRegression()
lin_reg.fit(train_x, train_y)
y_pred_lin= lin_reg.predict(test_x)
```
Accuracy of Model is: 0.5177053629131334
Root Mean Squared Error of Model is: 11.420285520195613

### Decision Tree Regressor
Decision-tree algorithm is a kind of supervised learning algorithms. It can be used in classification and regression problems. 

**Code for Decision Tree Regressor**
```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

dtregressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state = 0, min_samples_split=5)
dtregressor.fit(train_x, train_y)
y_pred_dt= dtregressor.predict(test_x)
```

Accuracy of Model is: 0.8204795438030693
Root Mean Squared Error of Model is: 6.9675118677407
