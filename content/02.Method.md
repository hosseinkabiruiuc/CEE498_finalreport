## Exploratory Data Analysis

It is done in order to analyze the data used for the project more comprehensively. In order to do so, the first step is to import the required libraires. And load the training, test and sample data.

Box plot analysis was performed:

The observations and comments that can be made from the above box plot is as follows:

1:The data in cement, slag, ash doesn't appear to have any significant outliers.

2: The data from water, superplastic, age, and strength appears to have some outliers, amidst them the age data has a long extension of the plot suggesting the highest amount of outliers amongst all of data columns mentioned.

Dsitribution of the variables in the dataset have been plotted to gain better understanding.

The observations and comments that can be made from the distribution plots and skewness degreee data is as follows:

1: The strength data is normally distributed.

2: Water and cement data seems to be very near to being normally distributed.

3: The data from age column as seen from box plot had a lot of outliers which is re-affirmed here with the distribution plot having very lengthy un-symmetrical extension beyond its mean value.

The observations and comments that can be made from the pair plots is as follows:

1: There is strong positive correlation between cement and strength which seems theoretically consistent.

2: In addition age also has a strong positive correlation to strength.

3: Water and strength have a negative correlation which aagain seems theoretically consistent.

4: Water and superplastic have a negeative correlation.

5: Slag, ash, coarseagg and fineagg are having poor correlation to strength so they aren't the best predctors of strength.

The observations and comments that can be made from the heat map is as follows:

1: Cement and age have strong correlation with strength

2: Water and superplastic have strong correlation

3: Superplastic has somewhat smaller but a postive correlation with strength
