## 4. Conclusion

Being non-linear and uncertain material, performace of concrete varies a lot with different constituents and their ratio. Performing compressive strength test for large set by crushing the clyinders is time consuming and prone to human error. Now, Machine Learning and ANN are taking place in mix deisgn becuase of its high accuracy and speed. Different training methods have been opted. Each method has its own merits and limitations. It is very crucial to understand the dataset first and then optimize the method.   
From the Exploratory Data analysis, it was found that Concrete strength has a very strong positive correlation with age and cement content. The correlation states that with the increase in the amount of curing time and cement content the strength of concrete would increase sharply. There was a significant negative correlation between concrete strength and water suggesting that increase in water content within the mix leads to degradation of strength. Prior to training of the model scaling of the dataset was needed and the high amount of outliers in the age variable data was taken into account.
Random Forest Regression shows best performance with RMSE of 5.505 and accuracy of 0.9. ANN generally shows good performance with large dataset. Small datatset limits its performance. The model shows potential to predict the strength of concrete with any new mix design or materials.
